- If I edit the Trip Name and go back to the trip list, the new trip name isn't reflected in the Trip list item
- Figure out date vs time
- Use toasts to display notifications and errors (Udemy React course 27.351)
- Use toasts to display cabin creation success (Udemy React source 27.353)
- Date picker on create trip form
- Validation for create trip form
- Confirm delete (Udemy React course 28.370)
- Loading indication for editing fields
- Put checkmark inside editable fields
- Put an x button inside editable fields and have "escape" and possibly "back" exit out of editing
- Date picker on editable field
- Date and optionally time?
- Have input box length fit content on large displays
- Have input box match the length of the value when the value is a long string
- Space the "edit" icon a little bit better
- Work on responsiveness for participant component. Make sure the input box doesn't overlap anything.
- Make the dev experience for the EditableField better. Passing in an onUpdate fallback is kind of ugly.
- Add margin above/below participant component
- Use a compound component to make the Form that can be reused to make CreateTripFrom and CreateParticipantForm
- Dive deeper into query keys and caching. Is the query key I'm using for useCreateCarpoolGroup appropriate?
